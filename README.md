# Machine Learning Automation 
Preview: It is a basic but useful project that helps to automate the process of Machine learning.

🔍 Problem : 
· Since I started my journey for achieving a career in data science, I faced many problems. One of the most common problem was to find the best algorithm that gives us the max accuracy on a particular data set. And I spent a significant amount of time manually executing each algorithm to see which had the highest accuracy. So one of my friends,Ruturaj Dhumal suggested, why not automate the entire process?

🛠️ Project functionalities/Flow :
· In this project, we can choose the appropriate machine learning algorithm based on the problem statement, such as classification or regression.
· After this, select the file or dataset to run the algorithms and obtain the accuracy.
· Then we have to select the algorithms, we can select one or all the algorithms if we want.
· After submitting, a table will display all selected algorithms and their respective accuracies, allowing you to easily select the method with the highest accuracy. 

📊 Technologies Used :
1) Html and CSS:
· Used for developing a webpage for taking the required input and displaying the output.
· It helped in building a well formatted, decorative and user friendly interface.
2) Backend( Python ) :
· Developed this project using Python. Because this language is simple to perform, etc.
3) Flask Framework :
· Used flask for integrating the frontend and the backend .
· It aided in project development by providing all necessary functionalities for a complete web application.
· I also used jinja2 technique which is provided by flask framework to display the required output.

📈 Advantages :
· We can upload files with.csv or.xls extension. Works great for both.
· It has the functionality of Standard Scaling, if required for the dataset
· We can also find the accuracy of a dataset which has a object/String column. t has the Encoding capability, which converts string data to numeric values.
· After showing the output in a tabular format, the accuracies are sorted in descending order; the highest accuracy at the top and lowest at the bottom. As a result, it becomes easier to identify the algorithm with the highest accuracy.
